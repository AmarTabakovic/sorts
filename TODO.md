# TODO
## Algorithms
- [x] Insertion sort
- [x] Quicksort
- [x] Mergesort
- [x] Heapsort
- [x] Radix sort (LSD)
- [x] Cocktail shaker sort
- [x] Gnome sort
## Functionality
- [x] Avoid any algorithm choices while an algorithm is running
- [x] Avoid any algorithm choices while algorithm is already sorted
## Nice-to-Have
- [ ] Variable array size
- [ ] Drag and drop lines
- [ ] Display number of array accesses and comparisons
- [ ] Display information about selected algorithm
## Miscellaneous
- Clean up code
    - Strange variable declarations (declare used variables at the top with `let`)
    - Comments
    - Proper variable naming
    - Extract reused functionality in separate methods (e.g. swap)
